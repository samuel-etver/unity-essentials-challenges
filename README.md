## Challenge 4

Used "Foundations of Audio" asset of Unity Technologies under Standard Unity Asset Store EULA 

### Project Objective

#### Explore and experiment with audio in Unity

* Define the role of an Audio Source, an Audio Clip, and an Audio Listener in a Scene.
* Implement audio that appears to come from a particular point in 3D space (e.g. localized sound effects) and audio that appears to come from no place in particular (e.g. background music).
* Configure the rolloff of an Audio Source in order to control how its volume changes with distance (e.g. logarithmic, linear, or custom).
* Programmatically play, pause, and stop sounds from a script in order to control audio effects based on certain events.
